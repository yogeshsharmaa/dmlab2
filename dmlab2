1)
SELECT V.VENDOR_NAME, COUNT(I.H_NO) AS INSTALLATION_COUNT
FROM VENDOR V, INSTALL I
WHERE V.TIN_NO = I.TIN_NO AND I.TYPE = 'DOMESTIC'
GROUP BY V.VENDOR_NAME
ORDER BY INSTALLATION_COUNT DESC
LIMIT 1;
 
 
 2). List the place name with the highest capacity panel installed:*
 
sql
SELECT U.USER_ADDRESS, P.PV_TYPE, P.CAPACITY
FROM PANEL P, INSTALL I, USER U
WHERE P.PV_NO = I.PV_NO AND I.H_NO = U.H_NO
ORDER BY P.CAPACITY DESC
LIMIT 1;

3)Display the area where monocrystalline panels are installed:*

sql
SELECT U.USER_ADDRESS
FROM PANEL P, INSTALL I, USER U
WHERE P.PV_NO = I.PV_NO AND I.H_NO = U.H_NO AND P.PV_TYPE = 'Monocrystalline';

4) For the specific area, display the total installation charges for both types of PV modules:*

sql
SELECT U.USER_ADDRESS, SUM(I.COST) AS TOTAL_COST
FROM INSTALL I, USER U
WHERE I.H_NO = U.H_NO
GROUP BY U.USER_ADDRESS;

5) List the details of distributors and panels that are the oldest installations:*

sql
SELECT V.VENDOR_NAME, P.PV_TYPE, I.INSTALL_DATE
FROM VENDOR V, SOLD_BY S, PANEL P, INSTALL I
WHERE V.TIN_NO = S.TIN_NO AND S.PV_NO = P.PV_NO AND P.PV_NO = I.PV_NO
  AND I.INSTALL_DATE = (SELECT MIN(INSTALL_DATE) FROM INSTALL)
ORDER BY I.INSTALL_DATE;

6)Find the average sales of both types of panels in only commercial places:*

 SELECT P.PV_TYPE ,AVG(I.COST) AS AVG_COST FROM INSTALL I ,PANEL P WHERE I.PV_NO=P.PV_NO AND TYPE ="COMMERCIAL" GROUP BY PV_TYPE;
